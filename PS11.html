<center><h4>The Man</h4></center>
<center><h3>The Myth</h3></center>
<center><h2>The <i>Legend</i></h2></center>

<br /> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's junior at Clairmont MacKena College, planning to major in Management and Science (Biotechnology Sequence), an interdisciplinary major which combines both a solid grounding in the sciences (particularly biological sciences) and managerial skills through business and economics. He's interested in healthcare, particularly in medical research and healthcare economics, and is going to have a prodigious career as a physician and/or researcher. And what's more--<i><b>He's better than you...</i></b></p>

<p>For starters, check out his <a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtuzjbMqbaU">super dope un-auto-tuned voice</a>. If this doesn't blow you away, then I don't know what will (other than something else he does).</p>

<p> And have you seen these guitar skills? </p>
